# MissingValues
This Repository is on how to impute the missing values with out of the box strategy. I have selected House Prices Data set where I am initially removing all the features which does not have missing values and going ahead with the problem as how to fill in the missing values when there are other missing values as well in rest of features.
All the comments on code are in the Notebook. Please feel free to reach out to me incase of any issues.
